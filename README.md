# Magic of programming
Magic of programming is a web app project that allows user to create their project portfolio. It was developed with ` python 3.9` and `Django 3.1.3`.

## Getting started
Virtual Environment files are included in a `venv` folder for fast deployment. Alternatively, use `pip` and `requirements.txt` file to install packages: 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

By default, the app uses SQLite for data storage. Before deploying on a production server, switch the database engine for security and performance.
